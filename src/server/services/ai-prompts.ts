Style: tight prose like a good blog post or short essay — no filler, every sentence earns its place. Vary rhythm (mix short punchy sentences with longer ones). Show, don't tell.

Mark 2-3 useful expressions in **double asterisks** (e.g. **catch someone's eye**). No other Markdown — no headings, lists, or rules.

Only describe what's visible; use "someone" if identity is unclear. Use search for recognizable people/places.

Output must sound natural read aloud (TTS).`;

For the given word, generate a JSON object with these fields:

1. familyComparison: Array of related/similar words (word family + common confusables).
   Each entry: { word, pos, distinction (核心区别 in Chinese), register (情感/语域 in Chinese), typicalScene (典型场景 in Chinese) }
   Include the target word itself as the first entry (highlighted).
   Include 3-5 comparison words.

2. familyBoundaryNote: A short paragraph in Chinese comparing 2-3 key pairs from the family (e.g. "X vs Y: X 是…；Y 是…"). Use concrete metaphors.

3. schemaAnalysis: Cognitive schema analysis.
   {
     coreSchema: one of "blockage" | "container" | "path" | "link" | "balance" (pick the closest),
     coreImageText: A paragraph in Chinese (2-3 sentences) describing the core cognitive image of the word — what mental picture it evokes, using the metaphor behind the word,
     coreSvg: A COMPLETE inline SVG string that vividly illustrates THIS SPECIFIC WORD's core meaning.
       SVG REQUIREMENTS:
       - Must start with <svg viewBox="0 0 600 180" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> and end with </svg>
       - Use an inline <style> block for CSS @keyframes animations (NO SMIL attributes like <animate>)
       - The visual must be a METAPHORICAL ILLUSTRATION specific to this word, not a generic diagram
       - For example: "perseverance" → a figure climbing a steep mountain with falling rocks, still moving up;
         "diverge" → a single path splitting into multiple colorful branches going different directions;
         "obscure" → a clear shape gradually being covered by fog/clouds
       - Use soft colors: teal (#2aa198), gold (#b58900), dark (#073642), muted gray (#93a1a1), cream (#eee8d5)
       - Add 2-3 subtle CSS animations (floating, pulsing, dashing, moving) to make it feel alive
       - Add short Chinese labels (1-3) at key positions using <text> elements, font-size 11-12px
       - Keep the SVG under 2KB — simple shapes, no complex paths
       - DO NOT use <image>, <foreignObject>, or external resources
     metaphoricalExtensions: string[],
     registerVariation: string,
     etymologyChain: Array of 2-4 short Chinese labels showing the semantic evolution stages (e.g. ["物理：昏暗/被遮挡", "认知：晦涩难懂", "社会：默默无闻"]),
     sceneActivation: Array of 2-3 scene frames, each:
       {
         title: "Scene N — [domain] ([frame name])" in English,
         description: A vivid paragraph in English describing a concrete scenario where the word applies,
         example: An example sentence in English using the word (wrap the target word in double asterisks),
         associatedWords: 4-6 related English words for this particular usage scene
       }
   }

4. boundaryTests: 3-4 fill-in-the-blank test scenarios.
   Each entry:
   {
     sentence: English sentence with a blank (use "______" for the blank),
     options: Array of 2-3 candidate words, each:
       { verdict: "yes" | "no" | "maybe", word: the candidate word, reason: short explanation in Chinese }
   }
   Include the target word and at least one confusable word from familyComparison in the options.

Return as a single JSON object.

Hard requirements:
- schemaAnalysis MUST be present.
- schemaAnalysis.coreSchema MUST be one of: blockage, container, path, link, balance.

All Chinese text should use Simplified Chinese.`;
